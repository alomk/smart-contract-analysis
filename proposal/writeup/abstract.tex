The Ethereum blockchain offers smart contracts as a way of handling financial promises. These are implemented as Turing-complete programs allowing a smart contract creator to execute arbitrary code in handling transactions. These smart contracts are available for public viewing and are susceptible to being exploited. We aim to do a security analysis on common smart contracts and explore what kinds of critical vulnerabilities may exist.
