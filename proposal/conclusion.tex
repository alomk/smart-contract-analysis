\section{Conclusion}
Ultimately, we hope to shed some light on the current unfortunate state of Ethereum smart contract security and potentially report bugs, making cryptocurrency a little safer.
Next steps from here may be directly fuzzing the Solidity compiler with randomly generated smart contract code and also fuzzing the EVM runtime as previously mentioned.
